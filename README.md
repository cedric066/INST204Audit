## Goals

The data is the Cook County Regional Intelligence spreadsheet of (anonymized) suspected gang members. We are looking to answer the following questions about the data:

* What does this dataset lead us to notice?
* What does this dataset lead us to ignore?
* What was required of other people to create this dataset?
* What technical or human systems were required to make this dataset?
* What possibilities for action does this dataset create? What possibilities does it foreclose?
* What assumptions about the world does this dataset make?
* How might this dataset change the way I interact with others, or how others interact with me?
* Who does this dataset empower?
* Does this dataset ask me to think less, or more?
* What does this dataset tell me about myself? What does it tell me about others?
* What is the mode of presentation of this dataset? Does it matter?
* Who is the audience for this data?
* Does the data make any implicit claims about the world?
